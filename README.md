## Machine Learning with Decision Trees
**Author:** Filiz İpek Oktay 

### Goal
The primary objective of Homework 2 is to introduce students to the machine learning experimental setup, focusing on gaining experience with the decision tree algorithm and utilizing the scikit-learn library. Additionally, students will learn to interact with AI tools using appropriate prompts.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this homework is sourced from Kaggle and has been modified for the assignment. The data includes information about penguins, featuring columns such as species, island, gender, diet, year of data collection, life stage, body mass, bill length and depth, flipper length, and health metrics.

#### Columns:
- **Species:** Species of the penguin (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)
- **Island:** Island where the penguin was found (Biscoe, Dream, Torgensen)
- **Sex:** Gender of the penguin (Male, Female)
- **Diet:** Primary diet of the penguin (Fish, Krill, Squid)
- **Year:** Year the data was collected (2021-2025)
- **Life Stage:** The life stage of the penguin (Chick, Juvenile, Adult)
- **Body Mass (g):** Body mass in grams
- **Bill Length (mm):** Bill length in millimeters
- **Bill Depth (mm):** Bill depth in millimeters
- **Flipper Length (mm):** Flipper length in millimeters
- **Health Metrics:** Health status of the penguin (Healthy, Overweight, Underweight)

**Download the data from SuCourse (cs210_hw2_dataset.csv). Utilize 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.**

### Task
Build a decision tree classifier using the scikit-learn library to predict penguin health conditions based on the 'Health Metrics' column. Ensure the dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing for accurate model evaluation.

### Instructions
1. **Dataset Download:**
   - Download the dataset named `cs210_hw2_dataset.csv` from SuCourse.

2. **Data Splitting:**
   - Utilize 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.

3. **Decision Tree Classifier:**
   - Implement a decision tree classifier using the scikit-learn library.

4. **Prediction:**
   - Predict penguin health conditions based on the 'Health Metrics' column.

### Notes
- Ensure to follow proper machine learning experimental setup protocols.
- Familiarize yourself with scikit-learn's decision tree functions.
